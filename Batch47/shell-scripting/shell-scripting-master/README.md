## Which Shell

There are wide variety of shells in market but which we are trying to learn here is BASH (Bourne Again Shell)

Back in Unix days, every vendor had their own shell.
1. SH
2. KSH
3. CSH 

Along with GNU, Couple of developers created a new shell having all the features of SH + KSH + CSH and named it as BASH.

BASH is default in any of the linux OS.

Hence we choose BASH

```
She-Bang (#!) 
    What She-Bang Does.
        1. Help you in identifying/mentioning which script it is 
               Ex:  Bash , #!/bin/bash
                    Python, #!/bin/python
                    
        2. It helps the script (code inside the file) to be executed with that interpreter

Note: She-bang should be kept only in first line, If you keep one more she-bang then that considers as comment.
